Admiral64
=========

Learning by failure.  A most likely impossible (for me) task, but I'm trying anyway.  A Commodore 64 simulator, as opposed to emulator.  No, or at least minimal, shortcuts, goal is to be as accurate as possible.  Nice if it'll run in realtime too, but not going to count on that.
